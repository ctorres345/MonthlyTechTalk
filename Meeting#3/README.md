# Meeting #3: Gap Buffer

In this session, we talked about the `Gap Buffer` data structure. It is commonly used
when implementing Text Editors.

In this meeting:
- We create a [SimpleStringTextEditor](SimpleStringTextEditor.kt) implementation using String manipulation.
- We create a [GapBufferTextEditor](GapBufferTextEditor.kt) implementation using a gap buffer.

You can [read about how Jetpack Compose leverages Gap Buffer logic to implement its Slot here](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/under-the-hood-of-jetpack-compose-part-2-of-2-37b2c20c6cdd).
